#  PURPOSE:

#  A chroot is an operation that changes the apparent root directory in
#  order to run certain processes.

#  These processes are performed within the $DIR_SQUASHFS_NEW directory,
#  which contains the top-level Linux system directories you see when you
#  open the file browser when running the Linux DVD.

#  The tasks to be done within this chroot directory include updating the
#  package list, upgrading the software, and installing KeePassX.   This
#  ensures that the new Linux ISO to be created includes pre-installed
#  KeePassXC and fully updated software.

#  The chroot operation ONLY sees what's within this $DIR_SQUASHFS_NEW
#  directory.  Anything outside this directory is not accessible.

# This substage establishes the bind mounts needed to allow chroot to work.
